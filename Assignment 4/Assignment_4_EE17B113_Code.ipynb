    "__Queue__ is a datatype into which multiple elements can be pushed and also can be popped. It follows a __FIFO__ style, meaning that the element first pushed into it, will be the first element to pop out.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Queue__ is a datatype into which also multiple elements can be pushed and also can be popped. It follows a __LIFO__ style, meaning that the element last pushed into it, will be the first element to pop out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operations in stack are as follows :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `push` : __$O(n)$ Time Complexity__\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the push operation of stack which pushes a new element into the stack, we do the following :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We first pop out the elements of stack from the queue which is used to store the elements of the stack into another temporary queue using __FIFO__ style\n",
    "2. We then first add the element to be pushed into the original queue, and then pop the elements from the temporary queue and push it into the original queue. Now the original queue which represents the stack contains the element in the correct position\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of step 1 is $O(n)$, since the time taken to pop from queue and push into queue is $O(1)$ and since we do it $n$ times, it becomes of order $O(n)$. The time complexity of second step is also of order $O(n)$ for the same reason. Thus the overall time complexity is $O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `pop` : __$O(1)$ Time Complexity__\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the pop operation which pops the last inserted element from the stack, we just pop the first element from the queue used to represent the stack, since due to the method of how we implemented the push operation, the first element in the queue will be the last element pushed into the stack, thus popping the first element of queue is equivalent to popping the last inserted element of the stack. Since pop operation in queue is of order $O(1)$, it is the same for this pop operation too.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `top` : __$O(1)$ Time Complexity__\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the top operation which returns the element at the top of the stack, we can just return the element at the front of the queue which can be accessed using the top operation of the queue. This is of order $O(1)$ too. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. `length` : __$O(1)$ Time Complexity__\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the length operation which returns the length of the stack, we keep a variable which stores the length of the stack. We increment it when we push an element into the stack and decrement if we pop an element.\n",
    "\n",
    "The edge case of `pop` or `top` from an empty stack can be handled in many ways, here we just return `None` if there is no element in the stack"

    "For converting an $n$-node binary tree into another $n$-node binary tree, we take an intermediate step of converting the initial $n$-node binary tree into an right-going tree using $O(n)$ rotations and convert the right going tree into the final form using $O(n)$ rotations, thus overall taking $O(n)$ rotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to prove that an arbitrary $n$-node binary tree can be converted into a right-going tree in $O(n)$ rotations. The algorithm to convert the tree is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take a left child of any element on the right subtree of the binary tree\n",
    "2. We apply a right rotation to this node, which increases the number of elements in the right-most tree by 1 due to the property of right rotation.\n",
    "3. We repeat this until the tree becomes right-going.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that one step of the above algorithm increases the number of elements in the right subtree by 1. Thus for a tree with $k$ elements in left-subtree, we need $k$ steps of the above algorithm to convert the tree into a right going tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The worst case situation occurs when the initial tree of $n$ nodes is left-going tree, i.e. te left most chain has $n-1$ elements. To change this tree into right-going tree, we need to do $n-1$ rotations to bring all the elements to the right. Thus the required number of rotations to convert a arbitrary $n$ node tree to a right going tree is $O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the number of rotations required to convert an arbitrary $n$ node tree to a right going tree is $O(n)$, the reverse of converting a right going tree to an arbitrary $n$-node tree also requires $O(n)$ rotations since we only need to apply the rotations in reverse to get the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, from the above statements, we have shown that converting any $n$-node binary tree to any other $n$-node binary tree takes $O(n) + O(n) = O(n)$ rotations\n",
